# LLM-Recommender-System
This project builds a smart LLM recommender from 2,440 Reddit posts. It uses BERTopic for topic modeling, RoBERTa for sentiment, and NER to find LLMs. A knowledge base aggregates sentiment by topic/LLM, so the final app can semantically match a user query and recommend the best LLM for that task.
